# CSC 335 Lab 2: BeyondBrad

We have a small Point of Sale terminal for a bread and sandwich shop that has a Loyalty Program 
to reward repeat customers. Every fifth visit, the customer gets a 10% discount.

We will model the store as a loop of customers who visit and make multiple orders. You
can close down the store by entering `exit`. This will permanently cause it to go
out of business (brutal!).

## Instructions

1. We have provided a UML diagram for the missing PunchCard class (CafeUMLDiagram.xml) that you can load into
http://draw.io to view. Turn that diagram into the implementation of PunchCard.

2. Modify CashRegister.java wherever you see `// TODO` and add visit tracking
and Nth-visit discounts to the customer's total. Remember, it's every Nth visit,
not just the Nth visit.

Add the other classes to the UML diagram and make sure to submit everything via
GitHub by the due date.
